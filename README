code of my research: multiple object tracking by dense motion analysis

version 1.0

procedure:
1. dense motion: SIFT flow
2. training affine models to fit the data
3. cluster affine model and get the centers

do 
4. assign each pixel motion to one of the centers
5. update the params of center affine model and then re-cluster
until centers meet certain condition
